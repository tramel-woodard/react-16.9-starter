# react-16.9-starter
Simple React 16.9 Starter Application (without Redux).

## Summary
This is a React 16.9 starter application meant for anyone who needs to generate a quick proof of concept template for work or to begin work on a personal project.

## Creation of Application
(**NOTE:** These instructions assume that you have already installed Node.js and can access npm from your computer's command line.)

This application can be generated from scratch by taking the following steps:

### Build your application directory
Open your preferred command line interface (i.e. Terminal on Mac, Run CMD on Windows, Git Bash on Mac or Windows). Locate a preferred space on your computer and create the **react-16.9-starter** directory:
```
mkdir react-16.9-starter
```

Change into the **react-16.9-starter** directory:
```
cd react-16.9-starter
```

### Initialize your application 
Generate a new package.json file in your new React directory:
```
npm init -y
```
(the **-y** switch will automatically populate all of package.json entries with their respective default values)
